<h2 align='center' border-bottom='none'>Buy Real Art: An eCommerce Site for Selling Art Prints</h2>

## Motivation
This site was created as part of Fullstack Academy's "Grace Shopper Project" that challenged students to design and implement their own eCommerce site. It includes all the features of a standard CRUD app, a RESTful API system, a relational database schema built on PostgreSQL, hashed and salted user data, Google Oauth integration, the ability to persist guest carts in local storage, page admin functionality and more.
